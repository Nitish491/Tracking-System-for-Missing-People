# Tracking-System-for-Missing-People
In Today’s world if a person is missing it is a tedious task for the policemen to track
that person by searching in streets or watching the CCTV videos to track the person
manually. Now, this task has become easy by our project ‘TRACKING SYSTEM
FOR MISSING PEOPLE’.
One main objective of the project is to develop a “Tracking System for Missing
People” that can be helpful for the common people whose beloved ones have been
abducted missed, or rescued by the people.
This is a software which can be used by any user for searching the missing person
where they want. It helps to keep a record of all the missing person and recovered
person .
In this software Using matching the information provided by informants to missing
person database to find the best matches.so that dependents can easily get their
missing person.
And person found (known or unknown) details are uploaded by the informants or by
dependent also.
Entering details of the children like height,age,complexion,weight will give more
presice to find the missing children,
To avoid the manual searching we use this online portal here,a person can upload a
picture of missing person and anyone who is using the internet can see those missing
person details and pictures of missing person easily without logged in.
The details provide by the informants will be mapped or compared with missing
person missing people details in the database and case details status etc can be
displayed
This MiniProject has been implemented using Html , Css , JS , PHP as Frontend and
